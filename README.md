# Sudoku
This is an algorithm, written in python to solve sudoku puzzles. It uses two layers, a simple logical reasoning level that can provide a solution in a couple of milliseconds and a more advanced Brute Force layer which uses a backtracking algorithm to make sure a solve is achieved. It can solve 400 sudoku puzzles in 28 seconds or so using this method.

The 400 test games are included to be tested.
